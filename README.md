# **Prison Cases & Deaths Analysis Using Power BI**
---

## Purpose  
This project aims to analyze data on inmate and officer cases and deaths within the prison system. It explores different facility types, states, and counties to provide actionable insights for better management and risk mitigation.  

---

## Objectives  
1. Provide a comprehensive analysis of inmate and officer cases and deaths.  
2. Identify states, counties, and facilities with the highest figures.  
3. Conduct comparative analysis of data across different facility types and populations.  
4. Enhance decision-making through data-driven insights.

## Report Structure  

Page 1: Overview  
- Description:  
   This page provides a general overview of the key metrics, offering a high-level comparison of total cases and deaths.  

- Key Metrics:  
   - Total Officer Deaths: 221  
   - Total Officer Cases: 112K  
   - Total Inmate Deaths: 2,595  
   - Total Inmate Cases: 526K  

- Visual Elements:  
   1. Donut Charts: Comparing maximum inmate population to cases and deaths.  
   2. Bar Charts: Displaying the top 10 states with the highest inmate cases and deaths.  

- Insights:  
   - California leads in inmate cases with 75K.  
   - Texas records the highest inmate deaths at 277.

Page 2: Cases & Deaths  
- Description:  
   This page delves into the data on deaths and cases, broken down by counties and facility types.  

- Key Metrics by County:  
   - Highest inmate cases: Yuma County (2,175 cases).  
   - Highest inmate deaths: Union County (62 deaths).  

- Breakdown by Facility Type:  
   - State-run facilities and local jails account for the majority of cases and deaths.  

- Visual Elements:  
   1. Bar Charts: Highlighting top counties for inmate cases and deaths.  
   2. Line Charts: Depicting trends in officer cases and deaths by facility type.  

- Insights:  
   - State and local jails remain high-risk areas requiring focused interventions.  

---

Page 3: Comparison  
- Description:  
   This page focuses on comparing trends in population, cases, and deaths across various facility types.  

- Visual Elements:  
   1. Bar Charts: Distribution of the latest inmate population by facility type.  
   2. Gauges: Comparing total deaths and total cases for relative insights.  

- Insights:  
   - State prisons and larger facilities show significant discrepancies between population sizes, cases, and deaths.  
   - Juvenile detention centers report minimal cases and deaths, reflecting a lower risk profile.  

---

Page 4: Analysis  
- Description:  
   This page provides in-depth analysis with visual comparisons between population sizes, cases, and deaths.  

- Visual Elements:  
   1. Pie Charts: Demonstrating proportional relationships between populations, cases, and deaths.  
   2. Bar Charts: Showing maximum inmate population in 2020 by facility type.  

- Insights:  
   - State prisons represent the largest population and most cases, making them a priority for interventions.  
   - Juvenile detention centers demonstrate successful management with low figures compared to other facilities.  

---

## Results  
- High-Priority States:  
   - Identified Texas and California as critical states for targeted interventions.  
- High-Priority Counties:  
   - Highlighted Yuma County and Union County as requiring special attention for inmate management.  
- Facility Insights:  
   - State-run facilities emerge as hotspots for cases and deaths.  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
1. Improved allocation of resources to high-risk facilities.  
2. Deeper understanding of population trends to guide policy-making.  
3. Actionable insights to reduce cases and deaths within the prison system.
