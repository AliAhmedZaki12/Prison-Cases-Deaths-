###  Page 2: Cases & Deaths  
- **Description**:  
   This page delves into the data on deaths and cases, broken down by counties and facility types.  

- **Key Metrics by County**:  
   1- Highest inmate cases: Yuma County (2,175 cases).  
   2- Highest inmate deaths: Union County (62 deaths).  

- **Breakdown by Facility Type**:  
   - State-run facilities and local jails account for the majority of cases and deaths.  

- **Visual Elements**:  
   1- Bar Charts: Highlighting top counties for inmate cases and deaths.  
   2- Line Charts: Depicting trends in officer cases and deaths by facility type.  

- **Insights**:

###  Page 3: Comparison  
- **Description**:  
   This page focuses on comparing trends in population, cases, and deaths across various facility types.  

- **Visual Elements**:  
   1- Bar Charts: Distribution of the latest inmate population by facility type.  
   2- Gauges: Comparing total deaths and total cases for relative insights.  

- **Insights**:  
   1- State prisons and larger facilities show significant discrepancies between population sizes, cases, and deaths.  
   2- Juvenile detention centers report minimal cases and deaths, reflecting a lower risk profile.

###  Page 4: Analysis  
- **Description**:  
   This page provides in-depth analysis with visual comparisons between population sizes, cases, and deaths.  

- **Visual Elements**:  
   1- Pie Charts: Demonstrating proportional relationships between populations, cases, and deaths.  
   2- Bar Charts: Showing maximum inmate population in 2020 by facility type.  

- **Insights**:  
   1- State prisons represent the largest population and most cases, making them a priority for interventions.  
   2- Juvenile detention centers demonstrate successful management with low figures compared to other facilities.

##  Results  
1. High-Priority States:  
   - Identified Texas and California as critical states for targeted interventions.  
2. High-Priority Counties:  
   - Highlighted Yuma County and Union County as requiring special attention for inmate management.  
3. Facility Insights:  
   - State-run facilities emerge as hotspots for cases and deaths.  



##  Expected Outcomes  
1. Improved allocation of resources to high-risk facilities.  
2. Deeper understanding of population trends to guide policy-making.  
3. Actionable insights to reduce cases and deaths within the prison system.
